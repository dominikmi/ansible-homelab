## ansible homelab set

There's just a bunch of ansible playbooks and roles for setting up and maintaining a homelab.
I am currently working on the following roles:

- `cfssl-pki` : automating cfssl based initial setup of internal ca, intermediate and server/peer/client certs for an internal domain,
- `livirt-vm` : setting up a libvirt vm, a placeholder for now, 
- `nomad-cluster-node` : Current 1.1.x Nomad cluster setup.
